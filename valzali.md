# Born peasant, grown noble

Valzali was born the son of servants, as most Verdans are. After his parents died however, he was adopted by their masters - one of the most famous families in Angar: the Anima. They raised him as one of their own and they came to love him, save for his brother, who seemed to despise him despite Valzali's adoration. 

As he grew, he realized that his perfect family was quite flawed and after discovering that it had been his adoptive mother who accidentally murdered his real parents, he decided to explore the world. Not because he now hated his family - no that was impossible - but because he could see how much suffering his presence brought to his mother.

# Love for creation

Valzali has always loved the concept of creation. Whether it be the world, art, technology or magic, the concept of bringing something to life has enamorated him since he can remember. However, he has always been incapable of creating anything himself - be it by his own lack of intelligence or his unskilled hands.

He tried to go to college, only to accidentally hurt others. He tried to work in his dad's factories, only to cause disaster. In the end, he decided that he was not meant to create, but to tell of creation and focused his efforts on the re-telling of stories.
