# Born in the wrong place

Rhyia is a free spirit - one that wants to make her own choices for her own reasons. This kind of spirit however, is not well looked upon in Tinu Iant where climbing the social hierarchy is everything. Between her free nature and her lack of interest in Astromancy, she was constantly fighting with her parents, who saw her mostly as a tool to climb the social pyramid.

This little familial war culminated in Rhyia marriage proposal, forced on her by her parents, who intended to marry her off to a much older, respected elf. Although her suiter was honored, Rhyia had no interest and attempted to get out of this marriage by spreading a false rumor that she was no longer pure. Soon after she was kidnapped, and turtured for the identity of her lover - one who did not exist. Unsatisfied with her responses, her captors abandoned her in a forest to die. Where she was saved, and then raised, a group of druids, who taught her the ways of nature.

# At peace with nature

Rhyia has always been lonely - she was ostricized by her kind, disrespected by her family and discarded by just about everyone. Only within the company of animals has the wood elf ever found peace. They do not judge her, they listen and respect her. Even when she is rude.

As such, she has come to prefer the company of nature itself and usually avoids interacting with others, which as granted her somewhat of a hermit-like lifestyle.
