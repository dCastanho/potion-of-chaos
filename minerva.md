# Out for Revenge


The fierce and determined minotaur, raised on a peaceful farm with her family, lived a life far removed from the violence of the outside world. Her days were spent tending to the land, caring for livestock, and enjoying the warmth of familial bonds. However, this tranquil existence was shattered when a group of ruthless marauders attacked the farm, killing her family and destroying everything she loved. Stricken with grief but driven by vengeance, the minotaur left behind her life of peace and set out on a relentless hunt to track down the killers, wielding both her physical strength and the pain of loss as her greatest weapons. Her journey became one of survival, revenge, and a search for justice in a world that had shown her only cruelty.

# Unstoppable 

Despite the horrors she has seen, Minerva has remained kind and gentle at heart. Although no door can stand in her way, and some cower at the mere sight of her, Minerva still strives to do what is best. She may not be of considerable intelligence, but even upon facing the murderers of her parents, she was capable of finding reason and justice - going as far as allowing one of them to live.
