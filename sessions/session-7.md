tldr: "In the caverns of Blackstone, Valsali met Cecie Cotton, a resilient halfling miner who, despite her doubts, helped him evade Bullseye Jack with her expert knowledge of the caves. Reuniting with the party, they discovered a mysterious garden atop a towering blackstone pillar, split into halves of crimson and white flora. As they examined an ancient gazebo, venomous centipedes attacked, forcing a harrowing retreat down a spiraling staircase. Though they narrowly escaped, their reprieve was brief as Bullseye Jack and a cloaked, commanding figure ambushed them, setting the stage for a fateful battle."

The group is faced with the hooded figure who led the bandits from the beginning. In an impulsive move, Valsali uses magic to reveal her true identity, exposing the mysterious figure. This revelation shocks Cecie Cotton, who recognizes Katelyn as the wife of the village leader.
Katelyn explains that her life before Blackstone was that of a mercenary, and her marriage to Neles was an arrangement to retire her family from that dangerous profession. While she respects Neles’ devotion to the village, she despises his bureaucratic, passive approach and feels suffocated by her domestic life. For Katelyn, action is always preferred over words, a philosophy that led her to ally with the bandits to protect the village.

Katelyn shares her dreams, which have a strange connection to the missing women. She first dreamed of Susana two months ago, then of Josselyn Cromwell a month ago, and recently, Maria Drake. The dreams, seemingly a challenge from the creature responsible, show the victims shortly before they disappear, implying that Katelyn has a role to play in this dark conflict.

She also explains that the mysterious book found in the caverns was discovered while the bandits were searching for Susana after her disappearance. They did not find her, only the book. When Katelyn asks for the return of the tome, the party reveals they no longer have it, increasing the tension.

Bullseye Jack, still furious over Josef’s death, demands revenge on the adventurers. However, Katelyn stops him, proposing an alliance with the group to defeat the true enemy: the shape-shifting creature that manipulates emotions. She shares her suspicions about Neles, pointing out that he vehemently denies the existence of something supernatural and blames everything on the bandits.

Katelyn asks the group to investigate Neles, as she believes his strange behavior may be connected to the missing women. Her proposal places the group in a dilemma: balancing Katelyn’s trust with the need to maintain Neles as a political ally.

Following another of Katelyn's suggestions, the group investigates Cas. In his home, they find a hidden letter from Josselyn Cromwell, exposing a heartbreaking story of betrayal:

> Cas, I thought I would find happiness and adventure with you, but you stole my heart and destroyed it. Cecie was the only one honest about what happened between you and Susana. I lost everything by believing in you. Now, I hope you feel the same pain you caused me, because she will be next.

When confronted, Cas confesses with shame and sadness. He admits that when he received the letter, he knew Josselyn had killed Susana. His own rage and guilt were amplified by a malevolent force, driving him to kill Josselyn in a blind fury. He claims to have buried her in a nearby forest.

---

The group follows Cas' instructions to the forest, but the burial site is empty. Instead, they find a trail that leads them to a gruesome sight: Josselyn's skinless body is crucified on a high branch, with a hole in her chest where her heart should have been. This horrifying discovery confirms that the creature is turning its victims into something far darker, increasing the urgency of their mission.
