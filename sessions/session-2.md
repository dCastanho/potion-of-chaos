The dawn broke over Blackstone Village, though the strange dreams of the night lingered like a storm cloud over the minds of the adventurers. Gathering in the bustling Cooking Pot tavern, they joined the patrons for breakfast, sampling Cooking Pot’s eclectic menu—meals fit for warriors and vegans alike. The jovial Tabaxi shared his grand dreams of expanding his business, envisioning a gym, a gladiator pit, and a chain of taverns that would transform the humble village into a city of strength and camaraderie.

When the party shared their troubling dreams, Cooking Pot revealed that they were not alone—many villagers had been plagued by recurring nightmares, which had sown fear and unease among the people. He spoke of a grimmer mystery: the recent disappearances of two young women, Susanna Wheatflow and Josselyn Cromwell. As he spoke, the tavern's energy shifted when he pointed out a potential culprit—a purple-skinned tiefling named Casimir, or Caz, seated among the patrons.

Caz, notorious for his flirtations and questionable work ethic in the mines, was suspected due to his closeness to both missing women. When confronted, he attempted to charm Rhyia, but her fortitude thwarted his ploy. Cornered, Caz admitted he had been part of the same friend group as the missing women, along with a halfling named Cici, another miner. He claimed innocence, suggesting he was an easy scapegoat due to his reputation. Despite his unconvincing exterior, his concern for the missing women seemed genuine.

The adventurers decided to dig deeper, starting with Susanna’s parents. The Wheatflows were retired historians who had sought the peace of Blackstone Village, only to be shattered by their daughter’s disappearance. They described Susanna as a curious soul, drawn to knowledge like a moth to flame. She had spent countless hours at the home of Gus Drake, the village sorcerer, poring over his vast collection of tomes.

Next, the party visited Gus’s residence, where they were greeted by his wife, Chanty, an elven druid and the village healer. Chanty was brewing sleep potions to ease the restless dreams plaguing the villagers. She confirmed that Susanna was her husband’s informal student, voraciously consuming the wisdom found in his books. Gus, however, was away delivering letters to their daughter, a university student in Angar learning the arcane arts. Chanty’s words painted a picture of a curious and ambitious young woman, but the mystery of her fate—and the deeper shadow over Blackstone Village—remained unsolved.

With threads of suspicion tangled around the tiefling Casimir, the mysterious Gus Drake, and the recurring nightmares, the adventurers prepared to delve further into the secrets that Blackstone Village seemed so desperate to hide.
