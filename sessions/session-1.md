title: The Shadows of Blackstone
tldr: "In Blackstone Village, beneath the ominous Blackmountain, three adventurers—Valsali, Rhyia, and Botas—unite to combat bandits disrupting the town’s trade. After a daring raid on the bandit camp, they uncover a sinister tome and troubling revelations, only to be haunted by eerie dreams of a shadowy figure, hinting at darker trials ahead."

The story of Cecie Cotton, a determined halfling miner, unfolds as Valsali encounters her amidst the darkened caverns of Blackstone. With pink-braided hair, piercing pink eyes, and a scar over her right brow, Cecie carried a chip on her shoulder, driven by her need to prove that her stature was no measure of her worth. Despite her determination, Valsali found her in tears, overwhelmed by feelings of helplessness. However, her spirits lifted when she helped him escape the relentless pursuit of Bullseye Jack. Her intimate knowledge of the caves became their salvation, reigniting her sense of purpose.

Meanwhile, the rest of the party explored the catacombs and found themselves at the threshold of a breathtaking and ominous sight. A spiraling staircase wound around the outer edge of an enormous pillar rising from the depths of a seemingly bottomless chasm. At the pillar's summit was a circular garden split into two distinct halves: one side teeming with flora of crimson hues and the other blanketed in pristine white vegetation. Streams carved into the blackstone floor meandered through the garden, leading to a gazebo of blackstone at its center.
The cavern, illuminated by a crevice in the mountain’s peak, resembled an extinct volcanic chamber. The interplay of light and shadow added an eerie serenity to the scene.
By a twist of fate, Valsali and Cecie tumbled through a burrowed tunnel, landing directly in the garden at the pillar's summit. As the group reunited, they examined the gazebo, discovering writings in an ancient script. Though the language was indecipherable to them, Botas, with his kenku gift for mimicry, memorized and transcribed two phrases into his journal, their meanings shrouded in mystery.

Their respite was interrupted by the emergence of a swarm of giant, venomous centipedes. Wounded and exhausted from their previous battles, the adventurers chose to retreat, carefully navigating back toward the catacombs. Using his bardic magic, Valsali created a sound-based diversion to lure the blind creatures away, allowing the party to descend the staircase.
Their escape grew more perilous as more centipedes climbed the pillar from below. Forced to remain utterly still, the party let the creatures pass within inches of them, their breath held in collective terror. When they were nearly safe, however, the centipedes detected their presence. Chaos erupted as the swarm attacked.
Botas was caught in the pincers of one of the monstrous creatures, his life hanging by a thread. Rhyia, thinking quickly, used her magic to transform the final stretch of stairs into a slide. As Botas tumbled toward the abyss, the party managed to seize him at the last moment, pulling him to safety.
Finally, back at the catacombs, they took a moment to rest. Valsali, with a heavy heart, decided to place Susana's body in his chest of holding, intending to return her remains to her grieving parents.

The party’s rest was cut short by an ambush. Emerging from the shadows were the remnants of the bandit force, led by Bullseye Jack, flanked by the soldiers Rhyia had healed earlier, and a cloaked figure radiating authority and menace. The figure, a woman cloaked in darkness, seemed to command the group effortlessly.
The adventurers braced themselves, battered but determined, as the confrontation that would test their limits loomed before them.
