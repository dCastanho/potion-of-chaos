    description: Cici's shy demeanour might seem like a weakness to most, but it has taught her to stay quiet even in the direst of situations.

  - title: Trustworthy 
    description: Cici is by far the most rational of the team - with a head screwed on straight, she is able to tell when the party is going too far. Except when her shyness gets in the way. As she becomes more comfortable with the team, however, she is becoming more and more confident in herself as well.

# Cobbler by day, Assassin by night

Cici's origins remote back to Angar, where her family ran a rather successful cobbling store. This store was, of course, just a front for the family's illegal schemes - murder, theft, whatever you wanted, so long as you could pay for it. Her grandfather, Thurman, started the business and it expanded to the whole family as both grew.

Cici was dragged into it without much choice of her own, and although she resisted, she never truly allowed herself to fight her family. Until one day, a job gone wrong led her to end the life of an innocent child and her mother. It was only then she was brave enough to flee the city and run to Blackstone, where she started to find a new family of friends.

# The Jonh Wick of Fantasy

Cici is a shy halfling who worked the mines, but her honest nature and skills rapidly lead the party to start trusting her. She never meant to be caught up in all of this - she just wanted to help her friends. But seeing others fight so dearly, showed her one could use their skills for good, regardless of their origin. 

And so, she retrieved what the thieving supplies she had hidden away and sworn to not use again. But for once, she wore her armor proudly, she swung her daggers with heart - for she knew that this time, she was not doing it for coin, but for the good of her new family.
